DO:
To do list:
	[X] Compile resources for movie list compilation
	[X] Compile resources for music list compilation
	[X] Compile resources for book list compilation
	[X] Make the book list an expanding list
	[ ] remove me-specific books from booklist
	[ ] Make 'to do next' list - start with organizing the book list.
	[ ] Compile resources for TV compilation
	
DO (low priority):
	[X] Add a favicon of a list to all pages
	[X] (Quick) edit down the filler text summarizing the project on index.html
	[X] Improve button css
	[X] Remove my email at the bottom of each page
	[X] Remove done checks from booklist on books.html

IN:
	For each category, add "why do X"? e.g., "Why read? Well - combination of practical importance, cultural importance, historical importance, and enjoyment. Most of humanity's insights are still contained in book form. And it's a very efficient way to consume information / audiobooks can be consumed on the go.
	Merge Theater and Film? (e.g. "watchable things" vs "listenable things" and "readable things")
	Separate fiction and nonfiction?
	List "merits" of each category. e.g.:
		Fiction: cultural relevance, historical relevance, technical merit, insight, beauty
		Nonfiction: presentation of scientific or historical facts, scientific or historical analysis, insight
		Music: technical merit, beauty, cultural & historical relevance, insight
	For the above, I should look up what makes a good book.
	Think about how to organize the subjects by genre
	Outline the expandable nature of the list
	Fill in an example of what a filled out entry looks like
	Think about how much to include. An arbitrary number of hours per consumption type? Plans (red, yellow, green, blue) based on 40, 160, 640, 2560 hours of effort?
	Add a 'methodology' page?

--------------- AARON'S THOUGHTS --------------
	- Alphabetical by author last name (for fiction, at least)
	- Separate fantasy, sci-fi and horror
	
	1Q84 - add to list - on greatest books list?
	Think about whether to move the biography and memoir section
